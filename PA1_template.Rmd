# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
x = read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(x$steps[!is.na(x$steps)], xlab = "Steps")
average = mean(x$steps[!is.na(x$steps)])
print(average)
med = median(x$steps[!is.na(x$steps)])
print(med)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
plot(x$interval,x$steps, type = "l", ylab = "Avg. number of Steps taken", xlab = "5 minute interval")
```


## Imputing missing values
```{r}
numna = length(x$steps[is.na(x$steps)])
A = which(is.na(x$steps))
for(a in x$steps[A]) {
     x$steps[A] = average }
qplot(x$steps, xlab = "Steps")
average = mean(x$steps)
print(average)
med = median(x$steps)
print(med)

```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
